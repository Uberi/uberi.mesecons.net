			<p>This article assumes you have the <a href="https://github.com/Jeija/minetest-mod-digilines/">Digilines mod</a>, which I generally consider a de facto part of Mesecons. It is still possible to complete it without this mod, but replacing its functionality with fancy wiring is an exercise left to the reader.
			<p>Don't you ever wish you had a clock in-game while playing Minetest, just to keep track of all the time you're wasting? Need a timepiece for the top of the main tower in town hall? Let's build one!</p>
			<img src="img/Clock.gif" alt="Clock" class="picture">
			<p>This clock will never need adjustment and works even if you use the /time command! This is made possible using the Digilines RTC.</p>

			<h4>Step 1: Design</h4>
			<p>Before we build anything, let me explain how the Digilines RTC works.</p>
			<p>The RTC, short for Real Time Clock, is a Digilines device that allows you to obtain the current (in-game) time of day. How does it work? When you plonk an RTC down, you can right-click it to set the channel:</p>
			<img src="img/RTC.png" alt="Real Time Clock" class="picture">
			<p>Now, whenever you send a digilines signal on that channel, using "GET" as the message, it will in turn send a digilines signal on that same channel, but with the current time as the message.</p>
			<p>However, this time isn't just in a standard time format; it's represented as fractional hours. Let's take a look:</p>
			<pre>/time 0 is midnight.
/time 500 is half-past midnight.
/time 7250 is around 7:15 AM.
/time 1500 is around 3 o'clock PM.</pre>
			<p>The thousands place and above denotes the hour in 24-hour notation, while the hundreds place and below denotes a fraction of that hour.</p>
			<p>When we get to the programming section, there will be a more detailed overview of how to deal with coverting this time into the one we're more used to.</p>

			<h4>Step 2: Layout</h4>
			<p>We want the clock to look as nice as possible. Therefore, we start from the display:</p>
			<img src="img/Display.png" alt="Clock display" class="picture">
			<p>Well this is a nice display and all, but there's one big problem with it - it doesn't display anything! Let's remedy that situation:</p>
			<img src="img/WiredDisplay.png" alt="Wired displays" class="picture">
			<p>Each digit display has been wired up to a standard seven segment driver supporting the digits 0-9, since that's all we really need. For the sake of completeness, here is the code inside each Luacontroller on the leftmost display (the ones column of the minutes):</p>
			<p>Top:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.type == "program" then
  mem.accept = {[0]=true, [2]=true, [3]=true, [5]=true, [6]=true, [7]=true, [8]=true, [9]=true}
elseif event.type == "digiline" then
  port.a = mem.accept[event.msg.minute]
  port.b, port.d = port.a, port.a
end</pre>
			<p>Second from top:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.type == "program" then
  mem.accept1 = {[0]=true, [4]=true, [5]=true, [6]=true, [8]=true, [9]=true}
  mem.accept2 = {[0]=true, [1]=true, [2]=true, [3]=true, [4]=true, [7]=true, [8]=true, [9]=true}
elseif event.type == "digiline" then
  port.b = mem.accept1[event.msg.minute]
  port.d = mem.accept2[event.msg.minute]
end</pre>
			<p>Middle:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.type == "program" then
  mem.accept = {[2]=true, [3]=true, [4]=true, [5]=true, [6]=true, [8]=true, [9]=true}
elseif event.type == "digiline" then
  port.a = mem.accept[event.msg.minute]
  port.b, port.d = port.a, port.a
end</pre>
			<p>Second from bottom:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.type == "program" then
  mem.accept1 = {[0]=true, [2]=true, [6]=true, [8]=true}
  mem.accept2 = {[0]=true, [1]=true, [3]=true, [4]=true, [5]=true, [6]=true, [7]=true, [8]=true, [9]=true}
elseif event.type == "digiline" then
  port.b = mem.accept1[event.msg.minute]
  port.d = mem.accept2[event.msg.minute]
end</pre>
			<p>Bottom:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.type == "program" then
  mem.accept = {[0]=true, [2]=true, [3]=true, [5]=true, [6]=true, [8]=true, [9]=true}
elseif event.type == "digiline" then
  port.a = mem.accept[event.msg.minute]
  port.b, port.d = port.a, port.a
end</pre>
			<p>The other displays have nearly the exact same code, except <code>event.msg.minute</code> is replaced with <code>event.msg.tenminute</code>, <code>event.msg.hour</code>, and <code>event.msg.tenhour</code>, from left to right for each digit display.</p>

			<h4>Step 3: Construction</h4>
			<p>Now we can wire up the timekeeping unit. First, a Digilines RTC is connected to a Luacontroller that polls it when we need it to:</p>
			<img src="img/Timekeeping1.png" alt="Clock connected to clock driver" class="picture">
			<p>The RTC, unsuprisingly, is set to the channel "clock".</p>
			<p>The code inside the Luacontroller is quite simple:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.type == "on" then
  digiline_send("clock", "GET")
end</pre>
			<p>Whenever any of the pins are turned on, it polls the RTC for the current time.</p>
			<p>The RTC can now be wired to another Luacontroller that does the calculations to convert the time into the hours and minutes most people are familiar with:</p>
			<img src="img/Timekeeping2.png" alt="Clock connected to display driver" class="picture">
			<p>A blinky plant is a very reliable oscillator. Luacontrollers and microcontrollers have delay capabilities, but they will not last past a server restart. Using a blinky plant ensures the clock will work regardless of the conditions it is in.</p>
			<p>The code inside the lower Luacontroller calculates the number of hours and minutes from the time value, and turns them into individual digits to be displayed:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.channel == "clock" then
  time = event.msg * 24
  hour = math.floor(time)
  tenhour, hour = math.floor(hour / 10), hour % 10
  time = (time % 1) * 60
  minute = math.floor(time)
  tenminute, minute = math.floor(minute / 10), minute % 10
  digiline_send("", {tenhour=tenhour, hour=hour, tenminute=tenminute, minute=minute})
end</pre>
			<p>After calculations, it sends off a Digilines signal with all the digits packed into a table. The field names should seem rather familiar - they are the same ones that we used in the displays!</p>
			<p>The only thing left to do is ensure the Digilines signal reaches all the displays:</p>
			<img src="img/FinalWiring.png" alt="Displays connected to clock" class="picture">
			<p>The displays update automatically as time passes by. It works!</p>

			<h4>Step 4: Improvements</h4>
			<p>The clock as it is right now doesn't look very good, with all those wires showing. How about an enclosure?</p>
			<img src="img/Final.png" alt="Clock with enclosure" class="picture">
			<p>Or perhaps a blimp?</p>
			<img src="img/FinalBlimp.png" alt="Clock with enclosure" class="picture">
			<p>After all, you can't have a world without blimps.</p>

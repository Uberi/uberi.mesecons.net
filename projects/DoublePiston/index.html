			<h2>The Double Sticky Piston Driver</h2>
			<h3>15/3/13 - Uberi</h3>
			<p>The double sticky piston driver is an important component of many circuits that need to push nodes farther than just one block.</p>
			<p>Here's a quick picture of what we'll be making:</p>
			<img src="img/DoublePiston.gif" alt="Double sticky piston extend/retract animation">
			<p>What we have is two pistons, one in front of the other. Let's call them the front and back pistons.</p>
			<p>When powered, it pushes a node forward by two blocks. When unpowered, it pulls a node backward by two blocks.</p>
			<p>This is a pretty simple circuit, but there are a lot nuances to be aware of with regards to timing and ordering. For example, an extended piston cannot be pushed or pulled correctly since the stopper is out, and a sticky piston pulls when it receives an off signal, but not when it is dug.</p>

			<h4>Step 1: Design</h4>
			<p>The first step in building something is knowing what you want to do. Let's see what we're looking for when doing pushing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The back piston is powered, pushing the front piston and node forward one block.</li>
				<li>The front piston is powered, pushing the node forward one block.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Pretty simple for now. How about retracting?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The front piston is unpowered, pulling the node back one block.</li>
				<li>The back piston is unpowered, pulling the front piston back one block.</li>
				<li>The front piston is powered, touching the node.</li>
				<li>The front piston is unpowered, pulling the node back one block.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The retraction is a bit more complex since sticky pistons can only pull one block at a time.</p>

			<h4>Step 2: Layout</h4>
			<p>First, we need to set up the basic components. In other words, the pistons and the node we are pushing/pulling:</p>
			<img src="img/DoublePiston1.png" alt="Two pistons and a node">
			<p>On the left we have the rear piston, on the middle, the front piston. To the right we find the node itself. I used cobble as an example.</p>

			<h4>Step 3: Control</h4>
			<p>Now that the pistons are in place, there needs to be some way of converting the on/off signal into the sequences described in Step 1. There are a whole bunch of ways you can go about this, but I find that the easiest way is to simply use a Luacontroller and wire three of the four ports into their proper places:</p>
			<img src="img/DoublePiston2.png" alt="Luacontroller wired to two pistons">
			<p>You'll notice that I connected the fourth, unused port to a switch. This will be our signal. When turned on, the circuit will perform the extension sequence. When turned off, the circuit will perform the retraction sequence.</p>
			<p>At the moment the circuit can be made significantly smaller, but we will cover that later.</p>

			<h4>Step 4: Programming</h4>
			<p>If you don't know much about Luacontrollers, you might find the <a href="http://mesecons.net/luacontroller/">Luacontroller tutorial</a> handy.</p>
			<p>We're going to first outline the basic actions the controller will perform:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if pin.a then
  --extend
else
  --retract
end</pre>
			<p>Then, work forwards through each sequence. I obtained the following as the final result:</p>
			<pre data-language="lua">if event.iid == "pull1" then
  port.b = false
  interrupt(0.2, "push2")
elseif event.iid == "push2" then
  port.c = true
  interrupt(0.2, "pull2")
elseif event.iid == "pull2" then
  port.c = false
else
  if pin.a then --extend
    port.b = true
    port.d = true
  else --retract
    port.d = false
    interrupt(0.2, "pull1")
  end
end</pre>
			<p>Congratulations! You now have a working double piston extender.</p>

			<h4>Step 5: Improvements</h4>
			<p>We're not done yet though. The circuit can still be made better. For example, we can remove the row of wires leading up to the pistons:</p>
			<img src="img/DoublePiston3.png" alt="Final design">
			<p>Or maybe a version embedded in the ground to gave a low footprint:</p>
			<img src="img/DoublePiston4.png" alt="Low footprint design">
			<p>Here I've replaced a bit of the ground with glass to better view the circuitry.</p>
			<p>The possiblities are endless. Play around with the concepts and see what you can come up with!</p>
